#Given the list lst = [1, 2, 2, 3, 3, 4], remove the duplicates and print the unique elements.

"""
Remove Duplicates from a List:
Given the list lst = [1, 2, 2, 3, 3, 4], remove the duplicates and print the unique elements.

Flatten a Nested List:
Given a nested list nested = [[1, 2, 3], [4, 5], [6]], flatten it into a single list [1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6].

Advanced Level:
List Slicing with Negative Indices:
Given the list lst = [10, 20, 30, 40, 50], use negative indices to slice the last 3 elements.

List Partitioning:
Write a function that splits a list into two parts: one containing all even numbers and the other containing all odd numbers.

List Rotation:
Write a function that rotates a list lst = [1, 2, 3, 4, 5] by k positions to the right. For example, rotating by 2 results in [4, 5, 1, 2, 3].

List Merging:
Given two sorted lists list1 = [1, 3, 5] and list2 = [2, 4, 6], merge them into a single sorted list.

List with Multiple Occurrences:
Given a list lst = [10, 20, 30, 20, 40, 50, 20], write code to remove all occurrences of 20 and return the updated list.

List to String Conversion:
Given a list lst = ['Python', 'is', 'awesome'], convert it into a single string "Python is awesome".

Find All Unique Pairs:
Write a function that takes a list of numbers and returns all unique pairs that sum to 10.

List of Lists Comparison:
Given two lists list1 = [[1, 2], [3, 4]] and list2 = [[1, 2], [3, 4]], compare the two lists and return whether they are the same.

List with Sorted Sublists:
Given a list of lists lst = [[3, 1, 2], [5, 4, 6]], sort each sublist in ascending order.

List Indexing with Multiple Criteria:
Given the list lst = [1, 4, 5, 2, 3], write code to find the index of the first element greater than 3 in the list."""
